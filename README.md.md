# AI Network Penetrator for Threat Analysis

This is a simplified, functional prototype of an AI-assisted penetration testing tool,
designed as a second-year project. It demonstrates the integration of
network scanning, a basic AI analysis, and a user-friendly web dashboard.

## Project Proposal Details

* [cite_start]**Project Goal**: To develop an AI-assisted penetration testing tool designed to analyze and secure networks. [cite: 3]
* [cite_start]**Vision**: Envisioned as a government-grade system that can identify vulnerabilities, analyze threats, and recommend solutions to strengthen network security. [cite: 4]
* **Key Features (Prototype Implementation)**:
    * [cite_start]**Automated Network Vulnerability Scanning**: Implemented via basic Python socket-based port scanning. [cite: 6]
    * [cite_start]**AI-based Threat Detection and Analysis**: A placeholder module that performs simple rule-based analysis of open ports. [cite: 6]
    * [cite_start]**User-friendly Web Dashboard**: Built with Flask for viewing results and generating reports (basic reporting included). [cite: 7]
